# intro_to_digital_feedback
an intro to digital feedback systems using openFrameworks and glsl
this can be controlled with the keyboard, the keys s, x, d, c, f and v will have effects on the feedback.  I reccomend looking at the code and/or the tutorial video associated with this project for more information it is heavily annotated.
