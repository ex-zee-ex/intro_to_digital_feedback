# intro_to_digital_feedback
an intro to digital feedback systems using openFrameworks and glsl
this can be controlled with the keyboard, the keys s, x, d, c, f and v will have effects on the feedback.  I reccomend looking at the code and/or the tutorial video (https://youtu.be/YLlKpfG-bos) associated with this project for more information it is heavily annotated.
a couple of things to note about using openframeworks projects downloaded from git if yr not familiar with troubleshooting these processes
openFrameworks project folders need to be unzipped and placed in the /apps/myApps subdirectory of wherever your openFrameworks directory is hanging out.  note that if you unzip this using the system default on osx it will make a folder called intro_to_digital_feedback-master and within that folder will be the folder intro_to_digital_feedback which you will move in its entirety over the myApps directory.  you also may get some errors when you first try to run this code, if so open up the project generator in the oF folder and choose "import", choose the folder intro_to_digital_feedback and click "update".  if yr still having errors after that drop me a line at ex.zee.ex at gmail dot com with a screenshot or two and i'll see what i can do! if youd like to learn more about coding feedback synthesis systems or any other aspects of creative coding techniques in oF, Processing, or glsl also feel free to drop me a line at that same email address I do online coding tutorial sessions for affordable prices!
